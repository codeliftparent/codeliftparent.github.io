Today is my first day in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and I am very excited to dive deeply into upgrading my programming, visualisation, and analytical skills. I am also looking forward to networking with my highly motivated classmates, mentors, and instructors.

**Why did I enroll in Udacity's DAND?**

There are numerous reputable providers of data analysis and data science instruction out there. I chose Udacity for five reasons:

* The courses focus on project based learning which is essential to data science training according to many of the prominent data scientists out there that share their wisdom on social media and LinkedIn.
* Part of Udacity's mission is to teach on the forefront of technology and to strive for up-to-the-minute relevance of their content. An absolute necessity in the rapidly evolving field of data analytics.
* Courses are designed in collaboration with industry leaders. If you want your training to make you truly "job-ready", this is essential.
* The projects you submit during the nanodegree are reviewed by experts who give you concise feedback and guide you through the process of improving your work until it's production level quality.
* The Udacity nanodegree is a great experience. Onboarding, instruction, projects, mentoring, career portal, etc... everything fits perfectly together and you feel supported at all times.

**Why I want to pursue data science**

I sincerely believe that I was born to help businesses and individuals unlock the value of their data, draw correct inference from available evidence and make decisions that are empirically sound and realise their goals.
My passion for all things data and quantitative analytics has accompanied me and brought joy to me almost all my life. The grammar school I went to focused on STEM subjects, I graduated from university with a degree in economics specialising in quantitative methods and statistical programming and was fortunate to get several work placements with renowned asset management firms and stock exchanges contributing value by developing software tools to support futures trading and analysis.
At the moment, I am a manager for a big international corporation while working proactively on making my career change into data science happening.
